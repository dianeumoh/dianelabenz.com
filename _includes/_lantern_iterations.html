    <h2>How will the home dashboard address user goals?
    </h2>
    <p>After completing the initial application process, the user is taken to the home page via a welcome email. For
      Lantern's home page dashboard, I thought about the following questions:</p>
    <div class="case-study-section__iteration-container">
      <div class="case-study-section__iteration-item">
        <h4>Dashboard V1: Utilizing a progress bar and checklist to show onboarding steps
        </h4>
        <p>I chose a progress bar and checklist to onboard the user in an unobtrusive and engaging way. However, skill
          certification is the only step a user needs to complete before applying to jobs. I decided the progress bar
          and
          checklist were not the right components to show a single next step.</p>

        <h4>Dashboard V2: Reducing the number of clicks to see available jobs</h4>
        <p>The number one reason that a user would return to Lantern is to search and apply for new opportunities. By
          making the home page the jobs page, the user is able to quickly accomplish this task.</p>

      <div class="case-study-section__iteration-item">
        <h4>Dashboard V3 (final): View the latest jobs and important announcements</h4>
        <p>From the initial login, users can see important announcements in the New For You section and view the latest
          jobs.
