    <h2>How will the home dashboard address user goals?
    </h2>
    <p>After completing the initial application process, the user is taken to the home page via a welcome email. For
      Lantern's home page dashboard, I thought about the following questions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>How will the user know what to do next?</li>
      <li>How do I reduce the amount of steps and time to search and apply for jobs?</li>
      <li>How do I encourage the user to return to the Lantern platform?</li>
    </ol>

        <h3>Dashboard V1: Utilizing a progress bar and checklist to show onboarding steps
        </h3>
        <p>I chose a progress bar and checklist to onboard the user in an unobtrusive and engaging way. However, skill
          certification is the only step a user needs to complete before applying to jobs. I decided the progress bar
          and
          checklist were not the right components to show a single next step.</p>

        <h3>Dashboard V2: Reducing the number of clicks to see available jobs</h3>
        <p>The number one reason that a user would return to Lantern is to search and apply for new opportunities. By
          making the home page the jobs page, the user is able to quickly accomplish this task.</p>
