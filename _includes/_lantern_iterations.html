    <h4>Dashboard Iterations</h4>
    <h2>How will the home dashboard address user goals?
    </h2>
    <p>After completing the initial application process, the user is taken to the home page via a welcome email. For
      Lantern's home page dashboard, I thought about the following questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How will the user know what to do next?</li>
      <li>How do I reduce the amount of steps and time to search and apply for jobs?</li>
      <li>How do I encourage the user to return to the Lantern platform?</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Dashboard V1: Utilizing a progress bar and checklist to show onboarding steps
        </h3>
        <p>In early iterations, I focused on a progress bar and checklist to encourage developers to complete the
          onboarding process, shortening the time it would take to apply for available jobs. </p>
        <p> I incorporated the job statistics card into the homepage dashboard to communicate the user's progress and
          reinforce the value of the Lantern platform.</p>

        <h3>Dashboard V2: Reducing the number of clicks to see available jobs</h3>
        <p>I spent time iterating on how the dashboard would evolve with the developers on their job hunt from initial
          login to
          three months on the platform. It became clear that the reason a developer would spend time on the platform is
          to find a
          job. While job statistics were helpful to the user, it wasn't relevant enough to the main user goal of quickly
          finding
          and applying for jobs.</p>

        <p>The homepage dashboard evolved to the jobs dashboard giving the user quicker access to jobs on the Lantern
          platform from login.</p>

        <h3>Dashboard V3 (final): Creating the best experience for users to find the latest jobs</h3>
        <p>The jobs dashboard utilized card components to house content such as:
          <ul>
            <li><span class="case-study-section--emphasis">New For You:</span> Onboarding instructions or platform
              messages</li>
            <li><span class="case-study-section--emphasis">Jobs You Might Like:</span> Personalized job recommendations
              based
              on the user's profile and activity</li>
            <li><span class="case-study-section--emphasis">My Profile:</span> At a glance profile and skill
              certification
              information</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Unlike other job boards, Lantern wanted to place less emphasis on the company and more emphasis on the
          technical stack and job description. Based on competitive and user research, I incorporated tech stack
          language logos to aid scannability in lieu of company logos.</p>
