						<p>After completing the initial application process, the user is taken to the home page via a welcome
							email. For Lantern's
							home page dashboard, I thought about the following questions:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>How does the user know what to do next?</li>
							<li>How many steps does it take to search and apply for jobs?</li>
							<li>Why would a user return to the Lantern platform?</li>
						</ol>

							<h5>Early Iterations: Too many steps to see relevant jobs</h5>
							<p>Early dashboard iterations included next step instructions for the user but it didn't address the
								user's
								ultimate goal, finding the right job.</p>

						<h5>The Jobs Dashboard: Addressing the <em>why</em></h5>
						<p>The number one reason that the user would back to Lantern is to search and apply for new
							opportunities. By making the home page the jobs page, the user is able to quickly accomplish the task
							at hand.</p>
