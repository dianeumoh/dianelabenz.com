    <h4>Design scope & strategy</h4>
    <h2>But when do you solve for an outdated UI?
    </h2>
    <p>Since loan officers were unable to complete all of their required tasks within the StreamLoan app causing a ton
      of friction, the <span class="case-study-section--emphasis">new loan requirements feature (phase 1) was
        prioritized over the redesign of StreamLoan's
        outdated and incorrect UI (phase 2)</span>. I worked with the client to help improve loan officer satisfaction
      with the new loan requirements feature.</p>
