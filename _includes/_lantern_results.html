    <h2>Evaluating MVP success
    </h2>
    <p>Deciding which features are needed for an MVP jobs platform required a careful balance of present and future
      planning. I worked closely with the founder to better understand how design decisions would impact future plans,
      immediate business needs, and technical level of effort.
