    <h4>Validation Test Learnings</h4>
    <h2>Industry terminology matters
    </h2>
    <p>Validation testing with loan officers revealed that they are <span class="case-study-section--emphasis">not
        legally allowed to approve loan conditions</span> (only underwriters
      can). To avoid friction, I changed the Approved submenu to Sent. The updated tab allows loan officers to see
      which documents were sent to the underwriter.</p>
